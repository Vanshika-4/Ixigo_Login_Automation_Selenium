## IXIGO LOGIN AUTOMATION WITH SELENIUM

In this implementation, the login process was performed using Google Sign-In. However, after some time, a CAPTCHA challenge is triggered, which cannot be automated due to its anti-bot design. As a result, manual intervention is required to bypass the CAPTCHA, making it a limitation for complete automation.
